Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Engineer specialised in state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing techniques. 
During my masters, I had developed my NLP and published one the most famous and powerful AI models for Arabic text representation. 
I also ranked in top places in almost all AI competitions that i participated in and was nominated for the Abdul Hadi Debs Endowment Award for Academic Excellence.

In addition, I have experience in teaching as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the Eng. faculty at AUB and as an AI instructor Zaka. 
I joined Siren Analytics as Data Scientist where I worked on various NLP, IR and Anomaly Detection problems that directly impacts the lebanese public sector. 
I'm now a Research Engineer in the ALMAnaCH team at Inria-Paris, continuing my research on enhancing text representation and model robustness to noisy text. 
I’m self-motivated, self-taught and a performer when working on tight deadlines. 
I’m also a tech geek who loves computer hardware and technology, and enjoys DIY projects and gaming.


% I'm a Machine Learning Scientist specialized in state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
% My research focuses mainly on language modeling, conversational agents and on the intersection of NLP and Information Retrieval.
% The output of my \textbf{2 years of Master's research} includes \textbf{7 peer-reviewed papers published in top NLP conferences} and a nomination for the Abdul Hadi Debs Endowment \textbf{Award for Academic Excellence}.

% My research contributions include:
% \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=-0.5em]
%     \item Language representation models for Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The highlight of them, \textbf{AraBERT: Transformer‑based Model for Arabic Language Understanding (2020)}, introduced a publicly available deep learning model for Arabic language understanding and is currently state-of-the-art on many Arabic NLP benchmarks and tasks. \textbf{AraBERT has been cited over 170 times with more than 10K+ downloads per month and was featured in MIT Technology Review}. As a recognition of my research, I was invited by PyData and King Saud University to present my work on AraBERT. 
%     \item Language models for Natural Language Generation (NLG), I published the \textbf{largest Arabic language model (1.5B parameters) for text generation, named AraGPT2} with the support of Google's TFRC program.
%     % which can generate news articles that are difficult to distinguish from human-written articles. 
%     I also worked on \textbf{conversational models for Arabic with empathetic and gender-aware responses}.
% \end{itemize}
% I recently \textbf{ranked first} among 74 teams in the largest Arabic Sentiment Analysis competition.
% Moreover, I have been reviewing papers for international peer-reviewed journals and venues in the AI and NLP domain.
% I gave multiple NLP workshops as an \textbf{AI instructor at Zaka}, in addition to my teaching experience that i gained as a \textbf{teaching assistant at the American University of Beirut}.
% I'm \textbf{currently a Data Scientist at Siren Analytics}, making use of my AI/NLP skills to solve various problems that directly impacts the public sector.
